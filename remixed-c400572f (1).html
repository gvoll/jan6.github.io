            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>Characterizing the violent mob as "peaceful protesters" or "tourists" despite extensive video evidence of assaults and destruction</li>
                <li>Downplaying the injuries sustained by law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol</li>
                <li>Suggesting the attack was orchestrated by government agents rather than Trump supporters, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary</li>
                <li>Proposing pardons for those convicted of violent crimes during the attack</li>
                <li>Attempting to reframe rioters as "political prisoners" or "hostages" rather than individuals convicted in court</li>
                <li>Dismissing the extensive Congressional investigation and court proceedings as politically motivated</li>
            </ul>
